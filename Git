 What is Git stash? (stack of unfinished changes)
 Often, when you’ve been working on part of your project, things are in a messy state and you want to switch branches 
 for sometime to work on something else. The problem is, you don’t want to do a commit of half-done work just so you 
 can get back to this point later. The answer to this issue is Git stash.
 
 Stashing takes your working directory that is, your modified tracked files and staged changes and saves it on a stack of
 unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.
 
 What is Git stash drop?
 Git ‘stash drop’ command is used to remove the stashed item. It will remove the last added stash item by default, and 
 it can also remove a specific item if you include it as an argument.
 
 git stash list --> list all items in stack  example
 stash@{0}: WIP on master: 049d078 added the index file
stash@{1}: WIP on master: c264051 Revert “added file_size”
stash@{2}: WIP on master: 21d80a5 added number to log

if you want to remove a item fro stack use
git stash drop stash@{0}
